ALeRT is a team of students and research assistants of the MASCOR Institute at FH Aachen University of Applied Science. The team was founded in January 2022 with grant from the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at FH Aachen and MASCOR. Our goal is to support first responders with autonomous robots in rescue scenarios. To evaluate the usability of the platform and our software stack in a rescue scenario, we participate in the RoboCup Rescue League.
